# warehouse-supply-chain — Warehouse / Supply-Chain Fulfilment Pod

A coordinator + specialists + humanoid actors + a finisher + two human roles that
run an outbound order end to end — **order → allocate + travel-minimised route →
reserve → pick (humanoid) → inspect → pack → rate-shop carrier → DISPATCH
(release gate + manifest) → load → ship** — with the standing supply-chain roles
running alongside (cycle-count / shrink control, returns, replenishment, supplier
relations, humanoid-fleet telemetry). Systems of record (WMS / TMS / ERP / fleet
API) are **tools inside the agents** — commented `mcp` blocks + dev-store
fallbacks that announce themselves — never members.

**Read `PRD.md`** for the full agent-by-agent spec. This is a **pod-standard
reference** (SDK 2.4.131): a team of self-reliant agents, not a pipeline.

## Why it works in an organization

Warehouse replenishment and fulfilment run on people watching dashboards —
someone allocates a pick, someone rekeys a count, someone rate-shops a carton by
hand, someone chases a damaged return. That routine is ~75% of the work and it
leaks money: shipping spend drifts 8–12% without per-parcel carrier selection,
and shrink hides in cycle-count variance nobody sweeps. This pod absorbs the
routine and **acts**, alongside the people who still own the calls. It wins the
honest way: **allocation's availability gate** never dispatches a picker for
stock that isn't free; **the exception handler** can't down-rate a safety,
damage, or high-value event — the deterministic floor re-asserts escalation from
the WMS unit value, not the model's guess; **the shipment dispatcher re-checks a
real release token** before it issues a manifest — a carton worth $500 or more
(the order's declared value), or one whose value it cannot find, waits for the
Warehouse Manager's release — and
**deletes a half-issued shipment** if its floor trips; **cycle-count fans out across zones** with each
copy claiming a disjoint batch, and the shrink floor re-asserts the 2% tolerance.
**Silence never advances an order**: a request nobody answers closes its Inbox
card and the ticket records that no reply came — nothing is released on
silence. Every pick, pack, ship, exception,
humanoid action, and held gate is hash-chained in a WORM ledger. Humanoids
(projected $3–8/hr) do the physical share; the agents do the judgment and the
paperwork.

## The team (18 members)

| Agent | Role (human job title) | Responsibilities | Can perform |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fulfillment_coordinator_agent` | Fulfilment Coordinator | Owns the order end to end; opens it, keeps live status, is the single contact | LLM; orchestrates allocation→…→dispatch; **listen_events** on OMS order stream (commented until vault connection `order_events` exists); escalates to the Warehouse Manager; **never allocates, picks, or releases** |
| `allocation_agent` | Slotting & Pick Planner | Pick path, batching, priority + travel-minimised route in one step | Programmatic; `@pre_compose` pulls order+bins; `@chain` **availability gate** (no dispatch on short stock) |
| `inventory_agent` | Stock Controller | Confirms stock + reserves units; absorbs inbound restock | Programmatic; store-grounded day-0; shortage → exception; commented WMS `mcp` |
| `exception_agent` | Exceptions Analyst | Classifies short-pick / damage / wrong-item / safety and briefs the floor | LLM + **playbook**; `@pre_compose` pulls order+value+unit; `@chain` **severity/safety floor** (fail closed) |
| `picker_humanoid` | Picker (Humanoid) | Physical pick from bins | Programmatic actuator; reserves a ready fleet unit; idempotent dispatch |
| `inspection_humanoid` | QA Inspector (Humanoid) | Verifies condition of flagged items | Programmatic actuator |
| `packer_humanoid` | Packer (Humanoid) | Packs picked units into a carton | Programmatic actuator; `@chain` **ship-readiness floor** |
| `carrier_selector_agent` | Transportation Analyst | Picks the cheapest carrier meeting the SLA | Programmatic; `@chain` **rate-shop floor**; commented TMS `mcp` |
| `shipment_dispatcher_agent` | Dispatch / Shipping Lead | Re-checks the release, renders the shipping manifest, hands to load | Programmatic **finisher**; release-token re-check → invariants → render manifest → **delete-on-block** → WORM ledger |
| `loader_humanoid` | Dock Loader (Humanoid) | Loads a released carton onto the outbound truck | Programmatic actuator |
| `returns_handler_agent` | Returns Clerk | Dispositions a return — restock / refurbish / scrap | Programmatic; store-grounded day-0; commented WMS `mcp` |
| `inventory_control_agent` | Cycle-Count Controller | Cycle counts, ingest, physical-vs-system reconciliation, shrink-zone detection | Programmatic; **scaling.copies** fan-out (atomic claim per zone) + **wake_up**/**timezone**; `@chain` **shrink floor** |
| `replenishment_planner_agent` | Replenishment Planner | Reorder recommendations off the SKU master; critical-stockout flag | Programmatic; store-grounded day-0; commented ERP `mcp` |
| `supplier_relations_agent` | Supplier Relationship Manager | Onboarding gates, alternate sourcing, quarterly scorecards | LLM + **super_agent** + **playbook** + dev-store lookup tools; `@pre_compose` pulls scorecards+history; **wake_up**/**timezone** |
| `humanoid_status_agent` | Fleet Telemetry | Humanoid battery / fault / location telemetry | Programmatic; fault → Ops Supervisor |
| `ops_supervisor_human` | Ops Supervisor (Human) | Floor decisions, exceptions, safety, humanoid faults | Human gate (Studio Inbox), **30 min** — resolved / held_for_review → audit; escalate → the Coordinator, which hands it to the Warehouse Manager |
| `warehouse_manager_human` | Warehouse Manager (Human) | Accountable owner: dispatch release of a $500+ carton, supplier gates, shrink | Human gate (Studio Inbox), **2h** (inside the day's carrier cut-off) — approved on a dispatch release → dispatcher; every other answer (approved / rejected / held_for_review) → audit |
| `warehouse_audit_logger_agent` | WORM audit | Hash-chains every pick, pack, ship, exception, humanoid action, and held gate | External (custom sink); terminus |

The **LeafMesh Manager** supervises; it is not a router in the middle of the
team. It escalates to the Warehouse Manager on a non-retryable error (auth, a
bad request, credit, bad config), when 3 different agents fail in one order, or
when restarts run out; a malformed hand-off only raises an alert. Safety /
damage / high-value exceptions reach the Ops Supervisor, and systematic shrink
reaches the Warehouse Manager, through the team's own wires. Human gates never
call each other (a `dual`→`dual` edge auto-bounces); a supervisor's
`escalate` goes through the Coordinator.

**If nobody answers.** Each human request waits for the time in the table
above. If nobody answers within it, the request waits no longer: its Inbox card
closes and the ticket records that no reply came. Nothing is released or
approved on silence, and nobody is chased automatically. (Each seat's
`fallback_response` — `held_for_review` → audit — states the intended
default-deny; leafmesh 2.4.486 does not route it for these seats yet.)

## Configuration — what to set, in three tiers

Everything is set in `.env` (create-leafmesh wrote it). The **whole chain runs on Tier 1
alone** against the seed store (`./data`): stock reads/reserves, cycle counts,
carrier rates, supplier scorecards, and the humanoid fleet are dev stand-ins that
**announce themselves** (`available: false`) until you wire Tiers 2–3.

### Tier 1 — required to boot (dev mode)
| Setting | For | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `LEAFMESH_LICENSE_KEY` | LeafMesh runtime | **Required.** |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Coordinator + exception + supplier + Manager (`gpt-4o-mini`) | **Required** unless you change the models. |
| `REDIS_HOST` / `PORT` / `PASSWORD` | State store | Defaults to `localhost:6379`. Bring your own Redis, or let `create-leafmesh --start .` start one. |
| *(no setting)* — human members | Human approvals | Answer in Studio's Inbox. To notify an external tool instead, create a vault connection (an "Add custom" record on the Infrastructure page, service type 'Outbound webhook') and set `webhook_config: {connection: <name>}` on the seat. |

### Tier 2 — real systems of record (create the vault connection, uncomment the connector block)
| Setting | Enables |
|---|---|
| vault connection `wms_mcp` | Real stock / reservations, returns, cycle-count reads |
| vault connection `tms_mcp` | Real carrier rate tables |
| vault connection `erp_mcp` | Real SKU master + reorder recommendations. The day-0 supplier tools in `agency/tools.py` check this vault record themselves; nothing goes in `.env`. |
| *(robot fleet API)* | Real humanoid fleet telemetry + dispatch — a PROD swap of `humanoid_status_agent`'s dev body; add a connector block picking its own vault connection |
| *(vault connection `order_events`)* | The Redis stream the OMS writes `orders.created` to — off on day 0; create the connection (its URL), then uncomment the `order_events` broker and the coordinator's `listen_events` (in Studio's raw YAML editor) |

> Server URLs and tokens are entered only in the vault (Infrastructure →
> Integrations → MCP, or an "Add custom" record with service type Tools), never in
> the configuration or `.env`. Every connector block ships **commented** in
> the configuration. These agents are `programmatic`, so the block is
> `integration: mcp` + `connector_config: {connection: …, tool_name: …}` (an
> `mcp:` list is refused on a programmatic agent), and the connector's response
> is handed to the agent's Python body as its first argument — adapt the body,
> create the connection, then uncomment — in Studio's raw YAML editor (see *Changing the configuration*).
> Until then the dev-store body answers and announces itself.

### Tier 3 — replace the dev store with your durable system of record
Swap the function bodies in `agency/_shared/store.py` for your WMS/ERP/TMS calls
(or point the `mcp` blocks at a gateway). The signatures are the contract — the
mesh does not change.

## Run it

```bash
# First, in .env (create-leafmesh wrote it): fill at least Tier 1.

# With Docker — starts Redis, loads the team into it once, starts the agency:
create-leafmesh --start .

# Without Docker — your own Redis (REDIS_* in .env):
pip install -r requirements.txt          # core LeafMesh + apscheduler runs the pod day-0
create-leafmesh --load .                 # loads the team into that Redis (only if it is empty)
python main.py                           # API at http://127.0.0.1:18820/docs
```

API calls (from `/docs`, curl or a script) need your organisation's API key in the `X-API-Key` header: make one in Studio → API Keys → Generate Key, then `export LEAFCRAFT_API_KEY=<the key>` for the examples below. The agency itself runs without it.

Place an order (day-0, against the seed store — no connector needed):

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18820/api/mesh/request \
  -H "X-API-Key: $LEAFCRAFT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entry_point":"order_placed",
       "data":{"order":{"order_id":"ORD-4471"}}}'
```

`ORD-4471` ($208) is the routine path and self-releases. `ORD-4490` over-demands
a short SKU on purpose — watch the availability gate raise a short-pick
exception instead of dispatching a picker. `ORD-4512` (5 × trail runners, $595)
crosses the $500 line, so its carton waits for the Warehouse Manager's release
in Studio → Inbox. On release, the
dispatcher renders the shipping manifest to `./out/` and appends
`./data/fulfillment_ledger.json`. Run the worked scenarios with
`python examples/run_examples.py` (after the team is loaded — see *Run it*).

> Packaging note: `pip install leafmesh` (core) includes all LLM providers and
> runs the pod; `apscheduler` powers the cycle-count / scorecard `wake_up` crons.
> For the real WMS/TMS/ERP connectors add `leafmesh[mcp]`; the `order_events`
> Redis stream needs no extra. Avoid `leafmesh[all]`
> on Python 3.12+ (it pulls `cchardet`, which has no wheel) — add only the
> specific extras you need.

## Changing the configuration

The agency's configuration lives in its store (Redis), not in a file: this project ships no configuration file. `create-leafmesh --start` loads the team's configuration into the store once, while the store is still empty (`leafmesh config import --if-empty`). `main.py` reads it from the store at start (`LeafMesh.from_store()`). A later start never replaces it, so what you change in Studio is kept.

To change it:

- **Studio** — its settings pages, or the raw YAML editor.
- **CLI** — `leafmesh config export > config.yaml`, edit it, then `leafmesh config import config.yaml` (it is checked before it is saved). `leafmesh config check`, `versions` and `rollback` check, list and restore versions.
- **API** — `PUT /api/yaml/raw` with an `X-API-Key` header and the body `{"yaml_content": "<the whole YAML>", "save_to_disk": true}`, or `PATCH /api/yaml/config` with `{"updates": {...}, "save_to_disk": true}`. Despite its name, `save_to_disk: true` saves the change to the store as a new version; without it the change is held only in memory and lost on restart.

Each save is a new version and applies live on every pod — no restart. (A few settings, such as brokers, make the agency reload itself in place within seconds.)

## Changing a running project (Docker)

What reaches a project that is already running (leafmesh 2.4.497). The
image holds the Python code (no configuration file); `.env` is passed in
when the container is created; the store (Redis) keeps the configuration
and the data on its own volume.

| You change | When it applies |
|---|---|
| An agent in Studio (prompt, model, tools, routes, human seats, schedules, …) | At once, no restart |
| A human seat's `channels` (Slack, email, …) | The agency reloads itself in place within seconds |
| Add or delete an agent in Studio | At once, including routes and schedules |
| A connection in the vault (model keys, MCP, webhooks, connectors, Slack, email) | At once. An agent switched off for a missing connection or address switches back on by itself |
| Anything in `.env` (licence, agency name, store, ports) | After `docker compose up -d` (the container is recreated) |
| Python code (`agency/*.py`: programmatic agents, tools, `@pre_compose`) | After a rebuild: `docker compose up -d --build` |
| The team's starting configuration | Loaded once by `create-leafmesh --start` into an empty store; after that, change it in Studio |
| Several app containers on one store | A Studio save reaches every one within about 15 seconds |

- Keep model keys in the vault. A key there wins over the same key in
  `.env` (the log warns), and a change applies at once. From 2.4.497 that
  holds for every value the vault holds (endpoints, organisation / project
  ids, cloud identities); the `.env` value returns when the record goes.
- Code the image does not have: an agent marked pure Python
  (`integration: python`) is switched off until its function is in the image;
  any other programmatic agent stays on, and each call to code it does not
  have fails. Rebuild the image with the code first.
- A new Redis volume is an empty store, so `create-leafmesh --start` loads
  the team again as version 1.
- **If the agency refuses to start after an upgrade** (a new leafmesh pin,
  then a rebuild: "Configuration has N error(s) in the stored
  configuration"), repair the stored configuration with the agency stopped:

  ```bash
  docker compose run --rm warehouse-supply-chain leafmesh config check      # each problem, with its line
  docker compose run --rm warehouse-supply-chain leafmesh config versions   # kept versions: which pass, which is in use
  docker compose run --rm warehouse-supply-chain leafmesh config rollback   # back to the newest version that passes (saved as a new version)
  ```

  Or `leafmesh config export > config.yaml`, fix it by hand, then
  `leafmesh config import config.yaml` (it is checked before it is saved).

## Where the data store is set

From leafmesh 2.4.482 the store (Redis or Postgres) is set **only in `.env`** — never in the agency's configuration. A `persistence:` block in the YAML is ignored with a warning on leafmesh 2.4.482–2.4.485; from 2.4.486 the agency refuses to start if that block differs from `.env`, and names each `.env` line to add. The project's `.env` sets the store explicitly (`LEAFMESH_STORE`, `LEAFMESH_AGENCY_NAME`, `REDIS_*`).

- Redis (default): `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_DB`; optional `REDIS_DEFAULT_TTL`, `REDIS_SESSION_TTL`, `REDIS_SSL*`, `REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES`.
- Postgres instead: `LEAFMESH_STORE=postgres` plus `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (optional `POSTGRES_SSLMODE`).
- Or the whole server in one value: `REDIS_URL=redis://user:pw@host:6379/0` (`rediss://` turns TLS on) or `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pw@host:5432/db`. The single names fill in what the URL leaves out.
- With Docker Compose the app reaches Redis as `redis` (the service name); compose sets that for you.
- Check it in Studio → **Infrastructure → Datastores**: it shows whether the store is reachable (never the address or password).

## This mesh's sign-in (leafmesh 2.4.497)

From leafmesh 2.4.497 each mesh signs in to LeafCraft with its own key, not
a key shared by every install.

- **First start.** The mesh makes a key pair and registers it with
  `LEAFMESH_LICENSE_KEY` and `LEAFMESH_ENV_TOKEN` from `.env` (copy the
  environment token from Studio — a placeholder such as `development` is
  refused). With both valid it works at once. If your organisation turned on
  "require approval", the first start stops and says so: approve it in
  Studio → **Keys → SDK access**, then start again. Organisation admins get an
  email for every new registration.
- **Where the key lives.** In the vault, in the store, encrypted with
  `LEAFMESH_VAULT_KEY`: it survives rebuilds and every copy of the app shares
  it. A new Redis volume, or a new vault key, makes a new key pair that
  registers again — revoke the old one in Studio.
- **Check or change it** (in Docker: `docker compose run --rm warehouse-supply-chain leafmesh auth status`):
  - `leafmesh auth status` — credential id, key fingerprint, registration and
    mode, never a key; `--check` signs in now and reports the tokens.
  - `leafmesh auth register` — register now.
  - `leafmesh auth rotate` — a new key pair: once it is active the mesh
    switches to it and revokes the old one. A revoked or expired key is never
    revived; rotate instead.
- **Lost the environment token?** From 5 Dec 2026 Studio shows the licence
  key and environment token only once, when they are made (then only a hint).
  Rotate the environment token in Studio and put the new one in `.env`.
  Rotating it changes where the agency's data is kept in the store, so do it
  before the agency holds data.
- **An existing project whose `.env` says `LEAFMESH_ENV_TOKEN=development`.**
  2.4.497 needs the real token. The token also names where the agency's data
  sits in the store, so with the real token the agency starts on an empty
  store (vault, sessions, board) — the old data stays under the old name. Set
  the real token before you put data in the agency, or contact us to move it.

## Your vault key — back it up

`create-leafmesh` put a `LEAFMESH_VAULT_KEY` in your `.env` when it made this project. It is the master key that encrypts every connection and credential you store in the vault (in Redis / Postgres).

- **Back it up like a master password.** Lose it and every stored connection has to be entered again.
- **Never change or regenerate it** for an existing project — a new key locks the existing vault. To change it, use `leafmesh vault rotate-key`.
- Every copy of the app (every replica) must get the **same** value. Docker Compose passes it in from `.env` as an environment variable.
- Never commit `.env` (it is already in `.gitignore`).
